### drakepkg ([Tiernan Martin](https://cascadiarconf.com/speakers/#tiernan_martin))
"The goal of drakepkg is to demonstrate how a drake workflow can be organized as an R package." I wonder if this might be a useful way to separate paper-writing from analysis code, which may be helpful for complex projects. Or, tips from the drake-driven structure of this package might be useful for including a drake plan in an _rrtools_ compendium package.

- Slides emphasize that you need to use drake::expose_imports() to bring the package into the drake environment

### workflowr
"Workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing time-stamped, versioned, and documented results." This seems useful for anything that can be posted publicly, unless you have a private GitLab server. 

The [example](https://stephenslab.github.io/wflow-divvy/) makes me think it would be great for tutorials.

### pkgdown
"pkgdown is designed to make it quick and easy to build a website for your package". At its simplest, its sounds like it it has 1) a home page generated from the packageâ€™s README.md, 2) a function reference generated from the documentation in the man/ directory, 3) results of any tests, and 4) changelog.
