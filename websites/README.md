## Websites with rmarkdown

Jan 2020

### Quick Start
Follow this (perhaps not super current, but easy to use) tutorial:
https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/index.html

1. Clone her repo: https://github.com/jules32/rmarkdown-website-tutorial
2. Open her RProj and click "Build". You should see her site build.
3. Create a repository to host your site, and create a gh-pages branch. Like she shows in the tutorial, click the "Settings" tab --> Branches to make gh-pages the default branch. Then check in "Settings/Options" that it is publishing a website from the gh-pages branch.
4. Clone your repository locally and switch to the gh-pages branch. Copy the tutorial site files into it.
5. Push these changes to gh-pages, and then view your website! You may have to wait a few minutes and also force refresh (Ctrl-Shift-R in Chrome) to see the site instead of the repo README. 
6. Modify the files in gh-pages, build locally, and push. The site should reflect those changes.
