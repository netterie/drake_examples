# Organizing your work with GitHub

- Please jump in 

- Issues Do's and Don'ts: 
    - Keep issues specific (examples)
    - Use GH Markdown
    - Self-reference (TOC example)
- Projects and Milestones can organize Issues 
    - Setting up new Project or Milestone (I like to have a Closed column)
    - Quick-add an Issue to P or M
    - Notes and columns in Projects
- Examples: 
    - EpiModelEDA Project
    - SHAMP Models Project - can use a Project as a reference page
    - SHAMP netdx Issue - but, we forget about it!
    - SHAMP GitBook links to these - perhaps that's how we can remember
- Pros and cons
    - Only use what you can keep track of
- Other Issue compiling mechanisms
    - README.md
    - Wiki
    - GitBook
