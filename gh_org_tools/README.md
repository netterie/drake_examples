# Organizing your work with GitHub

- Please jump in 

## Issues Do's and Don'ts: 
- DO use [GH Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), screenshots, and [cross-referencing](https://help.github.com/en/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests)
   - [Demo issue](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/issues/160)
- DO keep issues and issue titles specific, [like this](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/issues/142) [or this](https://github.com/statnet/WHAMP/issues/94). It's good for morale.
    - DO move your decision-containing emails over to an Issue!
- DON'T use broad issue titles [like this](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/issues/49) without imposing some organization
- DO organize broad/long issues using headers and updating the first post - can even [use post-specific links](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25163598/how-do-i-reference-a-specific-issue-comment-on-github) to [have a TOC](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/issues/134)
## Projects and Milestones can organize Issues 
- Setting up new Project or Milestone (I like to have a Closed column) - [P example](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/projects) and [M example](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/issues)
- Notes and columns in Projects - [can use GH markdown in Notes](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/projects/5)
- Quick-add an Issue to P or M - [example](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/issues/160)
## Project examples: 
- For cataloguing bugs/needs that arise: [EpiModelEDA Project](https://github.com/statnet/EpiModelEDA/projects/1)
- For planning ahead: [WHAMP ART-NET descriptives](https://github.com/statnet/WHAMP/projects/7)
- For documentation/reference: [SHAMP Models Project](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/projects/13)
- For losing track of work: [SHAMP Final 6 months](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/projects/11) or [SHAMP milestones](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/milestones) - we sort of forgot about them
## Projects and Milestones Do's and Don'ts
- DON'T make too many
- DO frequently revisit and (collectively?) work from the ones you make
## Other Issue compiling mechanisms
- README.md - like this one, or [this one](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/tree/master/egonet/data-prep/make_rda). Any folder in GitHub that has a README.md file will display that file when you browse the repo online.
